## Training data

Three predictive models will be compared with the observed notification data
for 2019. Predictions will be made on data from the 30 HBCs and the 6 WHO
regions and will be disaggregated by age group and sex.

The comparison will only use the predicted point estimates.

Similar to the final analysis, linear imputation will be used to replace
missing values in the 30 HBCs, but not in other country data.

```{r generate-ts-data, include = FALSE }
ts_list <- bind_rows(clean$region,
                     clean$imputed_hbc,
                     clean$global)  %>%
        filter(year <= 2018) %>%
        group_by(age_group, location, sex) %>%
        nest() %>%
        mutate(ts = map(data, function(series) {
                select(series, -year) %>%
                        ts(start = 2014, frequency = 1)
        }))
```

```{r comparison-data, warning = FALSE}

predictions_df <- map(models,
    function(model_params) {
            forecast_next_year(tbl = ts_list,
                               order = model_params,
                               drift = TRUE,
                               log_transform = TRUE) %>%
                    group_by(age_group) %>%
                    group_split() %>%
                    map(function(group) {
    data.frame(
      region = group$location,
      model = paste0(as.character(model_params), collapse = ", "),
      sex = group$sex,
      age_group = unique(group$age_group),
      year = 2019,
      point = as.numeric(map(group$forecast, ~ .x$point)),
      lower95 = as.numeric(map(group$forecast, ~ .x$lower95)),
      upper95 = as.numeric(map(group$forecast, ~ .x$upper95))
    )
  })
    }) %>%
        reduce(bind_rows)

```

Three models are being assess here - all with drift and log transformations:

```{r present-models, echo = FALSE}
models
```

The following models failed to estimate a prediction:

```{r failed-predictions}
predictions_df %>%
  filter(is.na(point)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

```{r comparison-plot }

comparisons_df <- bind_rows(clean) %>%
        filter(year == 2019) %>%
        mutate(model = "observed") %>%
        select(region = location, model, everything(), point = cases) %>%
        bind_rows(predictions_df) %>%
        select(-lower95, -upper95) %>%
  group_by(region, model, year, age_group) %>%
  summarise(point = sum(point), .groups = "drop") %>%
  filter(!is.na(point))

comparison_plot <- comparisons_df %>%
        ggplot(aes(
                x = region,
                y = point,
                color = model
        )) +
        geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
        facet_wrap(. ~ age_group, scales = "free_x") +
        coord_flip() +
        theme_bw() +
        labs(title = "Comparing 2019 notifications by age and location",
             subtitle = "Three ARIMA models against observed notifications",
             x = "Location",
             y = "Notifications")

ggsave(here::here("figures/dev/model_comparison.png"),
       comparison_plot,
       width = 15,
       height = 8)

comparison_plot
```

## Compare predictive differences

```{r create-observed, echo = FALSE}
observed_df <- clean %>%
  bind_rows(.id = "type") %>%
  filter(type != "global",
         year == 2019) %>%
  select(everything(), observed_cases = cases, -type)

```

```{r}

difference_df <- predictions_df %>%
  select(location = region,
         model, sex, age_group,
         predicted_cases = point) %>%
  right_join(observed_df, by = c("location", "age_group", "sex")) %>%
  mutate(diff = observed_cases - predicted_cases)


difference_df %>%
  group_by(model) %>%
  filter(!is.na(predicted_cases)) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            total_diff = sum(diff),
            abs_total_diff = sum(abs(diff)),
            abs_mean_total_diff = sum(abs(diff)) / n,
            .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(abs_mean_total_diff) %>%
  knitr::kable()

```

The model 2, 0, 0 with drift was ultimately chosen. One model within
this comparison related to this model did not generate a prediction, however,
when using the full training data it did generate a prediction.
